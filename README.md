# Python_shooting2dgame

## Description

The game was on a cartridge (i'm sure today's kids don't know what is that!), I put it in the slot, and boom the game is on the TV ready to be played.
This is an attempt to recreate the game after 32 years using Python programming language.
This was not easy to recreate and I had to look up a lot of the logic on internet.

## How to Play
You try to shoot the fireballs aiming your cities to defend your citizens.

To get the source code, you need to have Git and Python3 installed on your system.

Clone / download files from Github repository

Create a local virtual environment

`pip install pipenv`  if you don't have pipenv

Activate the environment

Install the dependencies

`pipenv install -r requirements.txt`

Run the game!!

`python missile-defence.py`
